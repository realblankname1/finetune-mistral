Diffusionmeters using visible light are found in airports or along roads to measure horizontal visibility. Radar scatterometers use radio or microwaves to determine the normalized radar cross section (σ0, \"sigma zero\" or \"sigma naught\") of a surface. They are often mounted on weather satellites to find wind speed and direction, and are used in industries to analyze the roughness of surfaces.',\n",

It was one of the most sacred Buddhist pilgrimage cities in the nation and a significant monastic center as well as a royal capital. The term \"Abhayagiri Vihāra\" refers not only to the complex of monastic buildings but also to a fraternity of Buddhist monks. It was founded in the 2nd century BC and grew into an international institution attracting scholars from distant locations. It played a significant role in the development of Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism. The complex includes the Abhayagiri Dagaba, an ancient stupa, and was a seat of the Northern Monastery and the original custodian of the Tooth relic in the island. \n",

The MetOp satellites gather detailed information about atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles, which is crucial for numerical weather prediction and climate monitoring. The mission consists of three satellites, MetOp-A, MetOp-B, and MetOp-C, which are flown successively for more than 14 years each. These satellites provide global coverage and contribute to the global meteorological satellite observing system. \n",
