Radar scatterometers use radio or microwaves to determine the normalized radar cross section (σ0, \"sigma zero\" or \"sigma naught\") of a surface. They are often mounted on weather satellites to find wind speed and direction, and are used in industries to analyze the roughness of surfaces.',\n",

It was one of the most sacred Buddhist pilgrimage cities in the country and a significant monastic center and royal capital. The term \"Abhayagiri Vihāra\" refers not only to the complex of monastic buildings but also to a fraternity of Buddhist monks. Founded in the 2nd century BC, it grew into an international institution, attracting scholars from distant locations and encompassing all shades of Buddhist philosophy. The complex included the Abhayagiri Dagaba, an ancient stupa, and was a seat of the Northern Monastery and the original custodian of the Tooth relic in the island. \n",

It stands for \"Meteorological Operational.\" The MetOp satellites are polar-orbiting satellites that provide detailed observations of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles. These observations are crucial for numerical weather prediction and climate monitoring. The MetOp mission consists of a series of three satellites, MetOp-A, MetOp-B, and MetOp-C, which are flown successively for more than 14 years each. These satellites gather essential data for weather forecasting and climate studies. \n",
